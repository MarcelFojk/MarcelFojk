# 👋 Hey, I'm Marcel

🎮 I'm a passionate **Unity Developer** who found his place at the intersection of science, design, and code.

## 🧠 About Me

I started my journey in science, graduating in **Biophysics** with a strong background in math and physics. While I once planned to pursue a PhD and a career in academia, I eventually discovered my true passion — **video game development** — a field that blends problem-solving, creativity, and technology.

I'm currently working as a **Unity Developer**, with a strong focus on **UI**, but also hands-on experience in **gameplay programming** and **network programming**. I love building systems that are not only efficient but also enjoyable for players.

In my previous role at Kinguin, I worked on the F2P title **Sneak Out**, where I was responsible for:
- Designing and implementing the entire **UI system and architecture**
- Creating responsive interfaces for both **PC and gamepad**
- Working closely with artists on **UX design**
- Developing various **multiplayer features** and **gameplay systems**

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

- Expanding my expertise in **gameplay and networking systems** within Unity
- Learning **C++** to deepen my low-level programming skills and prepare for future work in engines like Unreal
- Exploring **ShaderLab**, **HLSL**, and **Shader Graph**
- Building reusable, scalable UI/gameplay architecture
